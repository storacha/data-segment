   * 1. This reader has reached its “end of file” and will likely no longer be
   *    able to produce bytes. Note that this does not mean that the reader
   *    will always no longer be able to produce bytes. For example, underlying
   *    source may be a stream that simply does not currently have more data,
   *    but once more data is added read may succeed.
   *
   * 2. The buffer specified was 0 bytes in length.
   *
   * It is not an error if the returned value `n` is smaller than the `buffer`
   * size, even when the reader is not at the end of the stream yet. This may
   * happen for example because fewer bytes are actually available right now.
